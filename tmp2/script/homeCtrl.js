GREAT BY CHOICE -Jim Collins & Morten T. Hansen “Imagine being on a leisurely hike, wandering along warm, sunlit meadows, and your companion is a great mountaineer who has led expeditions up the most treacherous peaks in the world. You’d probably notice that he’s a little different from others, perhaps more watchful of the trail or more careful in packing his small day-pack. But overall, given the safe predictability of a glorious spring day, it would be hard to see what really makes this leader so exceptional. Now, in contrast, envision yourself on the side of Mount Everest with this same climber, racing a murderous storm. In that environment, you’d see much more clearly what makes him different and what makes him great.”
